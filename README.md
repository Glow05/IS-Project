An Object Identification Application for the CBC and Preschool Children
The proposed solution is coming up with an application that will help preschool children to identify and learn about objects surrounding them by just taking a picture of the object. 
The application will capture the object, detect it, and return the result to the child. 
Integrating the proposed solution to the new curriculum will be a fun way of learning for the CBC children without them getting bored or distracted.
